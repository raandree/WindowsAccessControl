## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add 27 pipeline-first commands for NTFS access rules, audit rules, ownership,
    inheritance, identities, privileges, effective access, and ACL diagnostics
- Add selected-section descriptor copy plus validated JSON backup and restore
- Add a Sampler build with PowerShell 7 and Windows PowerShell 5.1 test coverage
- Add command help, object formatting, usage documentation, and research notes

### Security

- Validate backup schema, record paths, item types, section masks, and SDDL
    before restoring security descriptors
- Persist only modified descriptor sections to avoid unintended SACL or owner
    changes during DACL operations

### Fixed

- Fix account-wide access and audit removal when `AccessRights` is omitted
- Validate all restore records before persisting the first descriptor
- Refuse to overwrite existing backup files unless `Force` is specified
- Treat disabling a privilege absent from the process token as a no-op
- Add destructive-mode, `WhatIf`, malformed-backup, orphaned-SID,
    noncanonical-ACL, and section-preservation regression coverage
